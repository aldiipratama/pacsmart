# 🛡️ The Arcade Rules (Code of Conduct)

## 🍒 Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## 🎮 The "Co-op Mode" Standards

We are here to play Co-op, not PvP. To keep the server healthy, here are the behaviors we encourage:

* **GG WP (Good Game, Well Played):** Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
* **Respect the Grind:** Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* **Constructive Crits:** Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* **Team Player:** Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.
* **Noob Friendly:** Helping beginners without being condescending. We were all Level 1 once.

## 💀 "Game Over" Behaviors

The following behaviors are considered **"Griefing"** and are unacceptable:

* **Trolling & Toxicity:** The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
* **Flaming:** Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* **Spamming:** Public or private harassment.
* **Doxing:** Publishing others' private information, such as a physical address, without their explicit permission.
* **Cheating:** Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## ⚔️ Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are the **Admins** of this server. They are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## 🔨 The Ban Hammer (Enforcement)

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at **[Masukan Email Kamu Di Sini]**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

1.  **Correction (Warning):** A private, written warning.
2.  **Warning (Yellow Card):** A warning with consequences for continued behavior.
3.  **Temporary Ban (Suspension):** A temporary ban from interaction.
4.  **Permanent Ban (Permabanned):** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

# 🛡️ Security Policy (Anti-Cheat System)

We take user system security seriously. Since **Pacsmart** runs with `sudo` access rights for package management, code integrity is our top priority (Main Quest).

## 📦 Supported Versions

Pacsmart is currently in its initial release (v1). We only provide security support for the latest stable version.

| Version | Supported          | Status           |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| v1.x    | ✅ Yes             | **Current Game** |
| < v1.0  | ❌ No              | **Alpha / Beta** |

## 🐛 Reporting a Vulnerability (Found a Glitch?)

If you find a security vulnerability (e.g., a script executing malicious commands, a privilege escalation issue, or a critical bug that damages the system):

1.  **DO NOT** open a public issue (GitHub Issue). We don't want to alert “Cheaters” before the vulnerability is fixed.
2.  **Send an email** directly to the main maintainer: **[Enter Your Email Here]**.
3. Use the subject line: `[SECURITY EXPLOIT] Pacsmart Vulnerability Report`.

We will respond as soon as possible and work with you to fix the “Glitch” before releasing the *patch* to the public.

Thank you for helping keep Pacsmart safe! 🍒
